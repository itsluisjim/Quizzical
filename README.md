# Quizzical
The Quizzical app is a React-based project that leverages an API to dynamically fetch randomized questions. This project serves as an excellent opportunity for learning and practicing various skills related to building custom React components, passing props, and effectively managing state within a React application. It was developed as part of a Scrimba React course, and its implementation is a testament to the developer's ability to apply key concepts and techniques taught throughout the course. The end result is a fully functional quiz application that provides an engaging and interactive experience for users.
